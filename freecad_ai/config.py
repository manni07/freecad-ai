"""Configuration system for FreeCAD AI.

Stores settings as JSON at <config-dir>/config.json. Path resolution:

  1. ``$FREECAD_AI_CONFIG_DIR`` env var when set (tests, power users).
  2. ``<FreeCAD user config dir>/FreeCADAI/`` when FreeCAD is importable.
     On FreeCAD 1.1+ this is ``~/.config/FreeCAD/v1-1/FreeCADAI/`` (or platform
     equivalent — version-scoped under XDG_CONFIG_HOME). We use the user
     *config* dir (XDG_CONFIG_HOME) rather than the user *data* dir
     (XDG_DATA_HOME, where ``Mod/`` lives) because the workbench stores
     config-shaped data: settings, secrets, conversation logs.
  3. ``~/.config/FreeCAD/FreeCADAI/`` legacy fallback when FreeCAD is not
     importable (pytest, console scripts, plain Python REPL).

A one-shot migration runs on first import per (target, marker) pair. The
migration looks at *historical candidate paths* in priority order, picks
the first one that has data as the source, ``shutil.move``s it to the new
target, and renames any stale leftovers as ``.duplicate-cleanup-<ts>/``.
A marker file inside the new target blocks subsequent re-runs.

On every launch (whether or not migration ran), a sweep also fires: if the
marker is present and any historical candidate path *still* has content,
that path is renamed as ``.duplicate-cleanup-<ts>/``. Catches the case
where an aborted/buggy prior migration left duplicate data behind.
