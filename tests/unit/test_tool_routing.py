"""Regression guards for the #28 tool-routing steering.

These are text-assertion guards, not behavioural tests: they lock in the
prompt/description cues that steer the model toward `create_sketch` for
"sketch on the selected face" instead of hand-rolling a raw
`AttachmentSupport`/`MapMode` macro via `execute_code`/`run_macro`.

They cannot prove the LLM routes correctly (that needs a live eval); they
prevent the steering text from silently regressing.
